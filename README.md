# Die-Rolling-Game

Create a 32-sided die rolling simulation ( possible outcomes 1 - 32 ).
1. Roll the die and reply with commentary based on the following flow chart. (Not posted here.)
2. Keep track and display the number of times the user has rolled, the number of times she won, and the number of times she lost.
3. Ask the user if she would like to “roll again?”.
